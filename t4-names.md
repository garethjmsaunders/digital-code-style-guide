## 1. Introduction

TERMINALFOUR is the company based in Dublin, and the software is also called TERMINALFOUR. In this document the software will be refered to as T4 and the company as TERMINALFOUR. 

Any new T4 assests MUST use these guidelines for naming.

---

## 2. T4 Assets

TODO: make sure section numbering is correct 

### 2.1 Section names

TODO: URL naming conventions need to be discussed or we need to know.

In T4 section names become the URL unless the output URI is specified, therefore the output URI MUST be defined. Output URI MUST use hyphens to separate words and all lower case letters.

```
events
current-students
alumni-and-development
```


For subjects they MUST have the subject first, then followed by speciality or otherwise

```
english
english-creative-writing
physics
physics-pod
```
### 2.2 Page layouts

TODO: Discuss more if we will need more than 1 or 2 page layouts. May remove this section if needed.
TODO: Need to research/test what is capable with programmable layouts

### 2.3 Content types

Content types should correspond 1 to 1 with the patterns in the Digital Pattern Library

### 2.3.1 Content names

Status of the size list MUST be in the name and the background SHOULD be in the name. TODO

```
Medium - Short title
Small - Short title
Hero banner - Grey
```

#### 2.3.1 Content type formatters

Name element field should never be output

#### 2.3.3 Element names

#### 2.5.4 List items

#### 2.3.2 Character limits

### 2.4 Navigation objects

### 2.7 Groups

### 2.7 Channel names

### 2.8 Media types

### 2.9 Media library

TODO Structure and heirarchy

### 2.5 File names

Filenames

TODO for t4: Regex pattern: ```(([a-z])+-*)*.filename```

Following this convention:

- Files SHOULD be named descriptively using lowercase letters.
- Words MUST be separated by hyphens.
- Filenames MUST never end with .inc. If you use an included file use a double suffix: .inc.php.
```
