TODO: Merge in style guide advice from Douglas Crockford (author of JSLint) http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html
TODO: Rewrite to be more prescriptive, and less first-person plural.




## 1. Introduction

JavaScript code SHOULD pass [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/). JSLint defines an opinionated subset of JavaScript with a very strict definition of acceptable style.




---

## 2. File format

### Unicode (UTF-8)

* Files MUST be saved with Unicode (UTF-8) encoding.
* Files MUST NOT be saved with the byte-order mark (UTF-8 with BOM).


### Use LF (Unix) line endings

Lines MUST end with a single, Unix-style line feed (LF) character.

Do not use carriage returns (CR) as used by Apple OS, or carriage return/line feed (CRLF) as used by Windows.

Ensure that your text editor is set up to save files with Unix-style line breaks. For example, in Sublime Text you can add the following to your user settings:

```
    "default_line_ending": "LF",
```




---
## 3. General formatting

### Indentation

JavaScript parsers do not care about indentation, it is solely used for the convenience of human readers. Indentation should be used to enhance readability of the source code.

* Do not indent code unnecessarily.
* Indent on purpose.
* Indent consistently.

Code indentation should always reflect the logical structure of the code.

* Use only spaces, and indent FOUR (4) spaces at a time. Spaces are the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any environment.
* Use spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs in your code. You should set your editor to emit spaces when you hit the tab key.
* Nested elements SHOULD be indented once (four spaces).


### Line width (80 characters)

Where possible, limit JavaScript files' width to 80 characters. Reasons for this include:

* the ability to have multiple files open side by side;
* viewing JavaScript on sites like GitHub, or in a terminal window;
* providing a comfortable line length for comments.

Do not worry about unavoidable exceptions to this rule, such as URLs.


### One statement per line

Statements SHOULD always be written one per line; do not combine statements on one line.

One statement per line makes code easier to read and compare using a diff tool.

At best multiple, combined statements makes code look messy and confusing, at worst it can contribute to the insertion of errors or missing something when reviewing code.

There MAY be some exceptions, such as `switch` statements, but readability and ease of debugging and code maintenance should take precidence over strict adherence to this rule, e.g.

```
switch (new Date().getDay()) {
    case 0:   day = "Sunday";        break;
    case 1:   day = "Monday";        break;
    case 2:   day = "Tuesday";       break;
    case 3:   day = "Wednesday";     break;
    case 4:   day = "Thursday";      break;
    case 5:   day = "Friday";        break;
    case 6:   day = "Saturday";      break;
}
```


### Semicolons

JavaScript uses semicolons (`;`) to mark the end of a statement; it is required on these statements:

* `break`
* `continue`
* `debugger`
* `do`
* `empty`
* `expression`
* `for` (separating control clauses)
* `return`
* `throw`
* `var`

Every statement MUST be followed by a semicolon except for

* `for`
* `function`
* `if`
* `switch`
* `try`
* `while`.

You MUST NOT rely on automatic semicolon insertion.

A code block, enclosed in braces `{...}` is not a statement, it is a group of statements. Each statement within the code block MUST be terminated with a semicolon, but the code block itself is NOT terminated with a semicolon.


### Parentheses

Parentheses SHOULD only be used where they are required. Additional parentheses may be used to clarify groupings in complex conditional constructs, but knowing operator precedence should eliminate their necessity.

When calling class constructors with no arguments, always include parentheses: The constructors are functions, so constructor calls need to look like function calls.

Never use parentheses for unary operators such as `delete`, `typeof` and `void` or after keywords such as `return`, `throw` as well as others (`case`, `in` or `new`).


### Brace style

You MUST use 1TBS (one true brace style) to indent braces, e.g.

```
if ( condition ) {
    action1();
    action2();
} else if ( condition2 && condition3 ) {
    action3();
    action4();
} else {
    defaultaction();
}
```

Braces MUST always be used, even when they are not required. This means that single-statement inline control structures MUST NOT be used.


### Single and double quotation marks

Use single quotes (`'`) for symbols, character constants, and internal strings such as property names.

Use double quotes (`"`) for strings that will be exported from the program, such as HTML fragments, URLs, or messages to the user.




---

## 4. Spaces

Spaces MUST always be inserted after commas, and on both sides of logical, comparison, string and assignment operators.


### Remove trailing spaces

You MUST remove trailing whitespace at the end of each line of code.


### Array items

Spaces MUST always be inserted after commas.

When referring to array items, one space MUST be inserted around the index ONLY if it is a variable.

```
x = [ 1, 2, 3 ];

x = foo['bar'];
x = foo[0];
x = foo[ bar ];
```


### Blocks

Spaces MUST be inserted on both sides of the opening and closing parenthesis of `if`, `elseif`, `foreach`, `for`, and `switch` blocks.

```
for ( expr1; expr2; expr3 ) {
    ... 
}

let iterable = [10, 20, 30];
for ( let value of iterable ) {
  console.log(value);
}

if ( x < 45 ) {
    else if ( x > 45 ) {
}

switch ( $i ) { 
    ... 
}
```


### Functions

When defining a function:

```
function my_function( parameter1, parameter2, parameter3 ) {
    ...
}
```


When calling a function:

```
my_function( parameter1, parameter2, parameter3 );
```


### Logical comparisons

When performing logical comparisons:

```
if ( ! $foo ) { 
    ...
}

x == 23;
baz === '-5';
foo && bar;
! foo;

```


### String concatenation

When concatenating strings using the `+` operator, a space MUST be inserted on both sides of the operator to improve readability.

```
institution = "University";
town = "St Andrews";
name = institution + " of " + town;
```

## 5. Comments

Comment as much as needed but not more. Comments are your messages to other developers (and yourself, if you come back to your code after several months working on something else). We prefer to use the `/* */` rather than the `//`.

TODO: Expand this. Consider JSDoc. Compare with PHP guide.

```
module = function() {
    var current = null;
    function init() {
    };

    /*
    function show(){
        current = 1;
    };

    function hide(){
        show();
    };
    */

return { init:init, show:show, current:current }
}();
```




---

## 6 Naming conventions

We call things by their name. Good variable and function names should be easy to understand and tell you what is going on â€” not more and not less. 

TODO: Expand this a bit more...

        <th>Entity</th>
        <th>Example</th>
    </tr>

## 7. Language specifics

### Avoid mixing technology

While it is possible to create everything you need in a document using JavaScript and the DOM it is not necessarily the most effective way of doing so. We could write CSS inline on a DOM element, but it would be far better to apply a class and let the styling be handled in the style sheet.

This
```
var f = document.getElementById('mainform');
var inputs = f.getElementsByTagName('input');
for(var i=0,j=inputs.length;i<j;i++){
  if(inputs[i].className === 'mandatory' &&
     inputs[i].value === ''){
    inputs[i].className += ' error';
  }
}
```

Not this
```
var f = document.getElementById('mainform');
var inputs = f.getElementsByTagName('input');
for(var i=0,j=inputs.length;i<j;i++){
    if(inputs[i].className === 'mandatory' &&
    inputs[i].value === ''){
    inputs[i].style.borderColor = '#f00';
    inputs[i].style.borderStyle = 'solid';
    inputs[i].style.borderWidth = '1px';
    }
}
```


### Eval

You MUST NOT use `eval`.

`eval` is probably the most misused feature of JavaScript, because there is almost always a better way to achieve the same thing.

See the [JSLint article](https://jslinterrors.com/eval-is-evil) for more information.


### Function arguments

Where possible, all function arguments SHOULD be listed on the same line.

If doing so would exceed the 80-column limit, the arguments must be line-wrapped in a readable way. To save space, you may wrap as close to 80 as possible, or put each argument on its own line to enhance readability. The indentation may be either four spaces, or aligned to the parenthesis.

Either of these is acceptable:

```
// Indent arguments by four spaces
function my_function( parameter1, parameter2, parameter3, 
    parameter4, parameter5 ) {
    ...
}

// Align arguments with first row
function my_function( parameter1, parameter2, parameter3, 
                      parameter4, parameter5 ) {
    ...
}
```


### Quoting strings

You SHOULD always use single-quotes (`'`) rather than double-quotes (`"`). This is helpful when creating strings that include HTML:

```
var msg = 'This is some <a href="#url">HTML</a>';
```


### Scope

<sub>From [JSLint][]</sub>

Declare all variables at the top of the function with one `var` statement. They should be listed in alphabetical order if possible.

```
var currentStudentID;
var graduationYear;
var orientation;
```


### Ternary operators

A ternary operator is a conditional operator that uses the syntax:

```
(condition) ? (if_true) : (if_false)
```

* Ternary operators SHOULD only be used for simple evaluations.
* Ternary operators MUST NOT be used for complex or nested conditionals.
* The complete statement SHOULD fit onto a single 80-character line; if the line exceeds 80-characters then split and indent across multiple lines, prefixing the true and false evaluations with the `?` and `:` operators.

```
(condition) 
    ? (if_true) 
    : (if_false)
```

## 8. JSLint configuration

The pattern library provides a JSLint config file that implements many of these rules and can be used to ensure that your code matches our work.
