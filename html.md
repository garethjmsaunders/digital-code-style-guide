## 1. Syntax 

### General formatting

* Use soft tabs with FOUR spaces. Spaces are the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any environment.
* Nested elements should be indented once (four spaces).
* Always use double quotes ("), never single quotes ('), on attributes. While optional, include quotes to improve code readability.
* Do not include a trailing slash on self-closing elements. These are optional in the [HTML5 specification](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/syntax.html#syntax-start-tag).


### Accessibility
* Do not set `tabindex` manually; rely on the browser to set the order.
* Paragraphs of text should always be placed in a `<p>` tag. Never use multiple `<br>` tags.


### Boolean attributes

Many attributes don't require a value to be set, like disabled or checked, so don't set them.

```
<input type="text" disabled>

<input type="checkbox" value="1" checked>

<select>
    <option value="1" selected>1</option>
</select>
```

For more information, read the WhatWG section.


### Comments

Avoid writing closing tag comments, like `<!-- /.element -->`. This just adds to page load time. Plus, most editors have indentation guides and open-close tag highlighting.


### Forms

* Lean towards radio or checkbox lists instead of select menus.
* Wrap radio and checkbox inputs and their text in `<label>`s. No need for `for` attributes here: the wrapping automatically associates the two.
* Form buttons should always include an explicit `type`. Use primary buttons for the `type="submit"` button and regular buttons for `type="button"`.
* The primary form button must come first in the DOM, especially for forms with multiple submit buttons.


### Lean markup

Whenever possible, avoid superfluous parent elements when writing HTML. Many times this requires iteration and refactoring, but produces less HTML. For example:

```
<!-- Not so great -->
<span class="avatar">
    <img src="...">
</span>

<!-- Better -->
<img class="avatar" src="...">
```


### Lists

List items should always be within `<ul>`, `<ol>`, or `<dl>` elements. Never use a set of `<div>` or `<p>` tags.


### Tables

Make use of `<thead>`, `<tfoot>`, `<tbody>`, and `<th>` tags (and scope attribute) when appropriate. (Note: `<tfoot>` goes above `<tbody>` for speed reasons. You want the browser to load the footer before a table full of data.)

```
<table summary="This is a chart of invoices for 2015.">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th scope="col">Table header 1</th>
            <th scope="col">Table header 2</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tfoot>
        <tr>
            <td>Table footer 1</td>
            <td>Table footer 2</td>
        </tr>
    </tfoot>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Table data 1</td>
            <td>Table data 2</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```




## 2. HTML5 doctype 

Use a doctype that triggers standards mode in your browser; this ensures more consistent rendering in browsers. Quirks mode should always be avoided.

For simplicity, use the HTML5 doctype:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```




## 3. Language attribute

The HTML5 recommends specifying a language attribute on the root HTML element. This aids speech synthesis tools to determine what pronounciation to use, translation tools what rules to use, etc.

Read more abount the `lang` attribute in the latest [HTML5 spec](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/semantics.html#the-html-element).

Sitepoint lists all [ISO two-letter language codes](http://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/iso-2-letter-language-codes/).


```
<html lang="en">
    <!-- ... -->
</html>
```


## 2. Coding style



## 3. Page Titles <a name="pagetitles"></a>

A standard format for the `<title></title>` tag.

<mark>Thoughts on using the dot `·` instead of `-`?</mark>

```
Page name · University of St Andrews
```

For example:

```
Summer schools and programmes - University of St Andrews
```

## 4. Error Pages

Error pages should be built such that they require zero scripting, zero JavaScript, and zero dependency on anything whatsoever. That means static HTML with inline CSS and base64-encoded images.

The following are banned from every error page:

* All `<script>` tags with an src attribute.
* All JavaScript that loads external data.
* All `<link>` tags.
* All `<img>` tags with an src pointing to a URL.

### Error templates

We use error pages for very specific purposes.


* **500** — An exception occurred and we couldn't recover.
<mark>See Github [500](https://github.com/500.html)</mark>

* **502** — The page likely timed out.
<mark>See Github [502](https://github.com/502.html)</mark>

* **503** — We are having a bad problem and the app server will not talk to us.
<mark>See Github [503](https://github.com/503.html)</mark>

* **404** — Not found.
<mark>See Github [404](https://github.com/404.html) and [404-pages](https://github.com/404-pages.html)</mark>

* **410** — Feature gone.
<mark>See Github [410](https://github.com/410.html). Not sure we need this one.</mark>

* **422** — When Nginx can't figure out what to do with your request, you could get this.
<mark>See Github [422](https://github.com/422.html). Don't need this.</mark>

* **maintenance** — For the rare case we must take the website down to perform maintenance. <mark>See Github [maintenance](https://github.com/maintenance.html). May need this for other systems, e.g. Pure.</mark>
